# ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà ROTKEEPER SCRIPT ‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë
# Script: rotkeeper.sh
# Purpose: CLI dispatcher for all Rotkeeper rituals
# Version: 0.2.1
# Updated: 2025-05-29
# -----------------------------------------

# --- LOGGING SETUP ---
# (Optional) Redirect stdout/stderr to a Rotkeeper log file:
# LOGFILE="bones/logs/rotkeeper-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
# exec > >(tee -a "$LOGFILE") 2>&1

# --- ERROR TRAP ---
# Catch any unexpected errors and report the line number.
# trap 'echo "üö® Unexpected error on line $LINENO"; exit 1' ERR

# Update this VERSION string with each release of rotkeeper.sh!
VERSION="0.2.1"
#
#
# Workflow overview:
# 1. Initialize environment:
#    There once was a setup so grand,
#    Directories rose on command.
#    With init in its core,
#    It prepared every door,
#    So rotkeeper‚Äôs rites wouldn‚Äôt unhand.
#    - Run rc-init.sh to set up directories, stub files, and initial render.
# 2. Expand content:
#    The expander would merrily grow,
#    Markdown rooms all in a row.
#    From BOM it would feed,
#    Each skeleton seed,
#    And fill them with text in a show.
#    - Execute rc-expand.sh to generate markdown tombdocs, config stubs, templates skeletons, and assets.
# 3. Render content:
#    A renderer fine took the stage,
#    Converting each tomb-page with sage.
#    With pandoc‚Äôs design,
#    It formed HTML fine,
#    From Markdown‚Äôs austere little cage.
#    - Invoke rc-render.sh to convert markdown files into HTML tombs.
# 4. Package output:
#    Then packer would tar every file,
#    With timestamp and manifest style.
#    A tomb in a tar,
#    Ready for war,
#    It archived each artifact‚Äôs dial.
#    - Call rc-pack.sh to archive rendered HTML into timestamped tarball and update manifest.
# 5. Audit and verify:
#    An auditor keen did inspect,
#    Every entry the manifest checked.
#    No missing remains,
#    No phantom domains,
#    Each file by its path was correct.
#    - Use rc-scan.sh to check manifest entries against actual files.
# 6. Asset manifest:
#    Assets were gathered in YAML lines,
#    From icons to fonts in confines.
#    The manifest grew,
#    With paths that were true,
#    A record of all design signs.
#    - Execute rc-assets.sh to catalog home/assets into bones/asset-manifest.yaml.
# 8. Help and usage:
#    And help was a guide in the dark,
#    A beacon, a bright little spark.
#    With usage in hand,
#    You‚Äôd summon the band,
#    To perform any command or mark.
#    - Display usage message for available commands.
