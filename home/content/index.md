# Rotkeeper: A Ritual CLI for Flat‑File Decay

Rotkeeper is a terminal-based toolkit for rendering, archiving, and preserving the remains of Markdown-driven projects.  
Each file is a tomb. Each version is a ritual. Each render is final.

---

## 🧪 Run It

To start rendering tombs:

```bash
./rotkeeper.sh render
```

See the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart-guide.md) to begin your first decay ritual.
