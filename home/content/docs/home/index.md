# 🏡 Home Folder

This is the root of user-controlled data within Rotkeeper. It contains editable tomb content, static assets, and generated reference pages.

It is organized for clarity, modifiability, and clean separation from system scripts.

## 🧭 Structure

```
home/
├── assets/       ← images, styles, downloaded remotes
├── content/      ← markdown docs, tomb files, static pages
└── docs/         ← script-generated reference pages
```

## 🔧 Managed By

These scripts reference or write into `home/`:

- `rc-render.sh` → reads from `home/content/docs/`, outputs to `output/`
- `rc-assets.sh` → scans rendered HTML and pulls from `home/assets/`
- `rc-api.sh` → downloads into `home/assets/remote/`
- `rc-docbook.sh` → emits script docs into `home/docs/`

## ⚖️ Notes

- You are encouraged to version control most of this folder — except:
  - `assets/remote/` (git-ignored)
  - anything manually test-generated

- The entire folder is user-owned and not overwritten by updates unless you allow it.
