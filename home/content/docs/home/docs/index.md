# ðŸ“œ Script Documentation (Generated)

This directory contains reference pages for each of the `rc-*.sh` scripts included in the Rotkeeper system. These are **not handwritten** â€” they are automatically generated from the script source code.

## ðŸ“¥ Source

The reference docs are produced by:

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-docbook.sh
```

It parses comments from the top of each script and emits Markdown pages into this folder.

## ðŸ§© Purpose

- Provide quick reference for each script
- Surface usage patterns, flags, and notes
- Enable searchable, rendered docs for offline use

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

This folder is not required for render or audit processes. It is optional and may be regenerated at any time.

- You may delete this folder without harming your tombs
- You may run `rc-docbook.sh` after changes to any script
- These pages are not typically edited by hand

## ðŸ”§ Git Policy

This folder is typically **not git-ignored**, but changes here should only be committed if useful to the project state.
