# 🧾 Asset Manifest

The asset manifest is a YAML file generated by `rc-assets.sh` that records all referenced assets in the rendered HTML files. It includes the relative path and SHA256 checksum for each asset.

This file is used by `rc-verify.sh` to confirm the presence and integrity of assets during ritual validation.

## 📍 Location

```
bones/asset-manifest.yaml
```

## 🔄 Generation

Run the following to generate or update the manifest:

```bash
./rotkeeper.sh assets
```

If assets are detected (e.g., from `src="/assets/...` in rendered HTML), the script will copy those files into `output/assets/` and record them with checksums.

## ✅ Example Entry

```yaml
- path: "images/rotkeeper-splash.png"
  sha256: "abc123deadbeef..."
```

## 🛠 Used By

- `rc-assets.sh`: Creates and updates the manifest
- `rc-verify.sh`: Verifies files exist and match their hash
- `rc-pack.sh`: Optionally logs the manifest in tomb summaries

## 💀 Failure Modes

- If the manifest is missing, `rc-verify.sh` will abort
- If any asset is missing or has changed, verification will log an error and return a non-zero status

## 📜 Notes

The manifest is **never committed to git** and is ignored by `.gitignore`.

It represents a local record of asset state and may vary between environments unless fully reproduced.
