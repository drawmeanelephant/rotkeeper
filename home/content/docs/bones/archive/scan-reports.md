# üîç Scan Reports

<!-- The council‚Äôs ledger of all scan report artifacts -->

## Location

- Directory: `/scan-reports/`
- Naming: `scan-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` and `.md`

## Contents

- **JSON files**: raw data with `missing`, `orphans`, and `digests`.
- **Markdown files**: human-readable summaries with sections:
  - Orphaned files
  - Missing entries
  - Checksum tables
