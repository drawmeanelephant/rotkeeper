# üîç Scan Reports

<!-- The council‚Äôs ledger of all scan report artifacts -->

The `scan-reports` archive contains chronological records of each `rc-scan.sh` run, including lists of orphans, missing files, and SHA256 digests.

## Location

- Directory: `/scan-reports/`
- Naming: `scan-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` and `.md`

## Contents

- **JSON files**: raw data with `missing`, `orphans`, and `digests`.
- **Markdown files**: human-readable summaries with sections:
  - Orphaned files
  - Missing entries
  - Checksum tables

## üß≠ Usage

<!-- How to browse the archived scan reports -->

To view the latest report:

```bash
less archive/scan-reports/scan-report-$(date +%Y%m%d-)*.md
```

To diff two reports:

```bash
diff archive/scan-reports/scan-report-20250526-*.md archive/scan-reports/scan-report-20250527-*.md
```
