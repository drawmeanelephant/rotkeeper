# üñ•Ô∏è Render Logs

<!-- The council‚Äôs ledger of HTML render process artifacts -->

This section archives the logs and statistics produced by each execution of `rc-render.sh`, capturing timing, template usage, and any errors or warnings.

## Location

- Directory: `archive/renders/`
- Naming: `render-log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` and `.md`

## Contents

- **Log files**: raw console output from the render pipeline.
- **Markdown summaries**: human-readable overviews of successes, failures, and timing.
- **HTML snapshots**: sample rendered pages for verification.

## üß≠ Usage

<!-- How to review archived render logs -->

To view the latest render summary:

```bash
less archive/renders/render-log-$(date +%Y%m%d-)*.md
```

To compare render timings between runs:

```bash
diff archive/renders/render-log-20250526-*.md archive/renders/render-log-20250527-*.md
```
