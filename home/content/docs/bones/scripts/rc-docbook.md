# ðŸ“– rc-docbook.sh

<!-- Converts Markdown with Rotkeeper frontmatter into DocBook XML for offline manuals -->

## Purpose
<!-- Core objectives of rc-docbook.sh -->
- Transform curated Markdown pages into valid DocBook XML chapters.
- Preserve metadata and section structure (frontmatter, headings, code blocks).
- Facilitate generation of cohesive PDF/HTML manuals.

## CLI Interface
<!-- How to invoke the DocBook ritual -->
```bash
rc-docbook.sh [--input <dir>] [--output <file>] [--toc <level>] [--help]
```

## Workflow Steps
<!-- Sequential rites performed by the script -->
1. **Verify Dependencies**
   - Ensure `pandoc` with DocBook support is installed.
2. **Gather Sources**
   - Read Markdown files from `<input>` directory.
3. **Extract Metadata**
   - Parse frontmatter for title, author, version.
4. **Convert to DocBook**
   - Invoke `pandoc` to produce DocBook XML.
   - Inject `<toc>` sections up to the specified level.
5. **Post-process**
   - Apply XSLT transforms if configured.
   - Validate resulting XML.
6. **Write Output**
   - Write combined XML to `<output>` path.

## Exit Codes
<!-- Symbolic outcomes of incantation -->
- `0` â€” Conversion succeeded without errors.
- `1` â€” Missing input files or directories.
- `2` â€” Pandoc or dependencies not found.
- `3` â€” XML validation errors.

## Examples
<!-- Sample invocations for celebratory rites -->
```bash
# Generate a complete manual XML
./bones/scripts/rc-docbook.sh --input docs/bones --output build/manual.xml --toc 2

# Produce a single-chapter XML
./bones/scripts/rc-docbook.sh --input docs/bones/scripts --output build/scripts.xml --toc 1
```


<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 1:
From markdownâ€™s plains to DocBook high,
rc-docbook lets your manuals fly.
It reads every note,
From frontmatterâ€™s quote,
And crafts XML that wonâ€™t lie.
-->

<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 2:
When manual builds felt dreary and long,
this script sang a transformation song.
With pandoc in play,
It led the way,
And made your docs sturdy and strong.
