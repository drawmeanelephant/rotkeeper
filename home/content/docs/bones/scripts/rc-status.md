<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 1:
To query the bones with a glance so wise,
rc-status lets no secret disguise.
It shows you the state,
Before itâ€™s too late,
And warns of decays in disguise.
-->

<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 2:
In the hush of the scriptâ€™s midnight tune,
status reveals what lurks in the tomb.
With version in line,
And logs all in time,
It guides your next ritual by noon.
-->
