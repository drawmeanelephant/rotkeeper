`rc-book.sh` is the central ritual binder for Rotkeeper. It consolidates multiple documentation and markdown rituals into a single interface, enabling project-wide compilation or collapse.

## ðŸ§° Usage

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-book.sh [--scriptbook|--docbook|--webbook|--all|--collapse] [--config FILE]
```

## ðŸ§¾ Flags

- `--scriptbook` â€” Extract script comments into `rotkeeper-manual.md`
- `--docbook` â€” Gather documentation into `rotkeeper-docbook.md`
- `--webbook` â€” Bind public content into `rotkeeper-webbook.md`
- `--all` â€” Run all three rituals (scriptbook, docbook, webbook)
- `--collapse` â€” (WIP) Convert markdown back into structured YAML
- `--config FILE` â€” Optional config for future inclusion/exclusion logic
- `--help` â€” Show help text

## ðŸ“¦ Outputs

Each mode writes to `bones/reports/`:

- `rotkeeper-scriptbook.md`
- `rotkeeper-docbook.md`
- `rotkeeper-webbook.md`

## ðŸ”® Future Work

- `--collapse` will eventually reverse `.md` output into `rotkeeper-bom.yaml`
- Support for `book-config.yaml` is planned to guide filtering and section control
