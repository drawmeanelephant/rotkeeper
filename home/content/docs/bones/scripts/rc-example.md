# rc-example — Example Utility Stub

<!-- NOTE: This is a documentation template only; rc-example.sh is not an actual script. -->

<!-- Purpose: stub generation ritual -->

**Disclaimer:** `rc-example.sh` does not exist in the codebase; this page serves solely as a model for documentation.

A concise overview of what `rc-example.sh` does in the Rotkeeper toolkit. Use it to kickstart new documentation pages with Rotkeeper conventions applied automatically.

***

## 📝 Overview

<!-- What the utility does, in ritual terms -->

The `rc-example.sh` utility jumpstarts your documentation workflow by generating fully-formed Markdown stubs that conform to Rotkeeper standards. **Purpose:** Provide a template for documenting Rotkeeper utilities. **Inputs:** Placeholder values or flags as defined. **Outputs:** A standardized documentation stub. **Typical use-case:** Bootstrapping new script documentation.

***

## 🚀 Usage

<!-- Invocation ceremony and flags -->

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-example.sh [flags]
```

**Flags:**

- `--help`, `-h` – Show usage information.
- `--example <value>` – Describe example flag purpose.
- `--force` – Force regeneration of stub.

### Examples

<!-- Demonstrations of stub generation -->

Generating the stub for a new script named `rc-foo`:

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-example.sh --script rc-foo
```

Forcing overwrite:

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-example.sh --script rc-foo --force
```

#### Expected Output

<!-- Sample result of the ritual -->

# rc-test — Example Utility Stub

A concise overview of what `rc-test.sh` does in the Rotkeeper toolkit.

***

## 📝 Overview

The `rc-test.sh` utility jumpstarts your documentation workflow by generating fully-formed Markdown stubs that conform to Rotkeeper standards.

***

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-test.sh [flags]
```

## 🗒️ Generated by

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-example.sh --script rc-test --dry-run
```
```

***

## 🔍 Details

When invoked, the utility loads its template and prepares the target directory, ensuring any existing stub is backed up if `--force` is used. It then validates inputs by checking that all required placeholders and flags are present and correctly formatted. After validation, the utility writes the output by emitting the markdown stub to the designated documentation location. Finally, it logs the status by reporting success or any errors encountered during the process.

***


## Roadmap

<!-- Aspirational stub-enhancement rites -->
- Add support for multiple template languages (e.g., YAML, TOML).
- Integrate Sora prompt hooks to auto-insert image stubs.
- Emit JSON schema for stub completeness checks.
- Add `--interactive` prompt mode for guided stub creation.

## 🎯 Future & Roadmap

### 🔧 Troubleshooting & Configuration
Expand the Troubleshooting section and introduce a Configuration chapter to cover setup options, flags, and template mapping in depth.

### 🤖 Sora Prompt Automation
Automate the insertion of Sora prompts into newly generated stubs, allowing templated visuals without manual edits.

### 🎭 Limerick Generator Hook
Integrate a hook to generate and embed limericks automatically, adding a layer of creative flair to each documentation stub.

### 🔍 CI Stub Validation
Implement continuous integration checks that validate front-matter, flag usage, and section completeness to ensure stub quality on every change.

***

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied when writing files**
  Ensure the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x bones/scripts/rc-example.sh`.
- **Missing template error**
  Verify that `bones/templates/doc.md` (or the specified template) exists and is readable.
- **Invalid flag or missing argument**
  Run `./bones/scripts/rc-example.sh --help` to see valid flags and required parameters.
- **Backup failure with `--force`**
  Confirm the target directory is writable and you have necessary permissions to rename or delete backups.
- **Unexpected YAML parse errors**
  Check front-matter syntax for missing dashes or incorrect indentation.

<!--
A fresh stub gleams at dawn’s first light,
Drafted for rot-keepers’ delight.
With sections in place,
It quickens the pace,
And guides future script scribes aright.

<!-- ROT-RECORD
A place for limericks and invisible rot notes.

## 💤 Haiku

### v1

> Stub freshly minted
> Guides rotkeeper scribing chores
> Tomorrow we fill

> Empty pages wait,
> Words to dance in quiet halls,
> Scripts breathe life anew.

### v2 (Bonus)

> Chop code into bits,
> Rotkeeper binds in tarballs—
> Sleep tight, tomb awaits.

## 🗒️ Enhancement Roadmap

- [x] Expand the Examples (dry-run invocation, backup stub demonstration)
- [x] Fill Out Troubleshooting (add common pitfalls and fixes)
- [x] Polish the Future & Roadmap (turn bullets into mini-sections)
- [x] Sprinkle More Flavor (extra limerick, bonus haiku, new Sora prompt)
- [x] Rework the Haiku Section (merge or clearly label versions)
- [x] Standardize Frontmatter & Footers (ensure consistent separators, ordering, and comments)

<!-- 🎴 Limerick 1:
To stub out docs with a magical twist,
rc-example appears on the list.
With empty page shine,
And metadata fine,
It starts every manual off crisp.
-->

<!-- 🎴 Limerick 2:
In caverns of code where skeletons roam,
rc-example finds its doc-home.
It writes with great care,
A template laid bare,
And guides scribes to flesh out each tome.
