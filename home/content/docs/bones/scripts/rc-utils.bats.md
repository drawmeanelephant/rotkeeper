# ðŸ§ª `rc-utils.bats`

This file contains the test suite for verifying core utility functions defined in `rc-utils.sh`.

It is written using [Bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the Bash Automated Testing System, and lives at:

```
bones/scripts/rc-utils.bats
```

---

## âœ… Covered Functions

- `log()`: Ensures timestamped log output to stdout and optional `$LOG_FILE`
- `run()`: Executes or logs commands based on `DRY_RUN` setting
- `require_bins()`: Fails gracefully when binaries are missing
- `trap_err()`: Logs the error line number and exits with status 2
- `resolve_script_dir()`: Returns the source path of the script calling it

---

## ðŸ§« Notes

- The `run()` function is not available in subshells, so tests that call `run run ...` are skipped.
- `trap_err()` forcibly exits the shell, which interferes with Bats output capture â€” this test is also skipped.
- All test logs are written to `bones/logs/test-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Running Tests

You can run the test suite manually:

```bash
./bones/scripts/rc-utils.bats
```

Or integrate into your CI pipeline via a wrapper like `rc-test.sh`.

*This test suite is part of the Rotkeeper v0.2.6-dev ritual hardening effort.*
