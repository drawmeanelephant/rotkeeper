# ðŸŒ± rc-expand.sh

<!-- The sacred rite of content stub generation -->

## Purpose
<!-- Core objectives of rc-expand.sh -->
- Read `rotkeeper-bom.yaml` to identify tomb sections and asset patterns.
- Generate initial Markdown files and directory structures for each section.
- Populate frontmatter and stub headers for future content.

## CLI Interface
<!-- How to invoke the expansion ceremony -->
```bash
rc-expand.sh [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--help]
```


# Note: rc-expand.sh now skips tomb manifests with `status: draft`.
# Flags:
#   --dry-run (-n)  Preview actions without creating files; skips drafts.
#   --verbose (-v)  Show detailed logs.
#   --help (-h)     Show usage information and exit.

## Workflow Steps
<!-- Sequential rites performed by the script -->
0. **Lint Frontmatter and Filter Draft Tombs**
   - Invoke `rc-lint.sh` to validate frontmatter of tomb manifests.
   - Skip any tomb manifests where `status: draft`, logging a notice.
1. **Parse Flags & Setup**: Handle `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--help`.
2. **Determine BOM Path**: Resolve `rotkeeper-bom.yaml` relative to script.
3. **Generate Stubs**: Create directories and markdown files with frontmatter.
4. **Copy Scripts & Resources**: Replicate scripts, configs, templates.
5. **Finalize**: Copy BOM for future runs and log completion.

## Dependencies

- `bash` (â‰¥5.0)
- `yq` (â‰¥4.2) for parsing YAML tomb manifests.
- `rc-lint.sh` for frontmatter validation.

## Exit Codes
<!-- Symbolic outcomes of incantation -->
- `0` â€” Stubs generated successfully.
- `1` â€” BOM file not found or parse error.
- `2` â€” I/O error during directory or file creation.

## Examples
<!-- Sample invocations for celebratory rites -->
```bash
# Default expansion
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh

# Preview expansion without changes
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --dry-run

# Verbose expansion with detailed logs
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --verbose

# Show help
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --help

# Dry-run example (skipping drafts without writing):
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --dry-run
```

<!--
Limerick 1:
From BOMâ€™s deep vaults, the stubs emerge,
rc-expand guides each hollow dirâ€™s surge.
It weaves frontmatter light,
In the still of the night,
And readies pages for loreâ€™s great purge.

Limerick 2:
In corridors of YAML decree,
rc-expand unlocks each MD entry.
It scaffolds with grace,
Then vanishes its trace,
Leaving blank tomes for scribes to decree.
