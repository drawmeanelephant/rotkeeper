ðŸŽ¨ Sora Prompt:
"A spectral workshop where ancient BOM scrolls unroll themselves into blank Markdown templates, awaiting the scribeâ€™s ritual incantations."

<!-- Begin Ritual Script Documentation -->

# ðŸŒ± rc-expand.sh

<!-- The sacred rite of content stub generation -->

## Purpose
<!-- Core objectives of rc-expand.sh -->
- Read `rotkeeper-bom.yaml` to identify tomb sections and asset patterns.
- Generate initial Markdown files and directory structures for each section.
- Populate frontmatter and stub headers for future content.

## CLI Interface
<!-- How to invoke the expansion ceremony -->
```bash
rc-expand.sh [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--help]
```

Supported options:
- `--help`, `-h`
  Show usage information and exit.
- `--dry-run`
  Preview actions without writing stubs.
- `--verbose`
  Show detailed logs.

## Workflow Steps
<!-- Sequential rites performed by the script -->
1. **Parse Flags & Setup**: Handle `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--help`.
2. **Determine BOM Path**: Resolve `rotkeeper-bom.yaml` relative to script.
3. **Generate Stubs**: Create directories and markdown files with frontmatter.
4. **Copy Scripts & Resources**: Replicate scripts, configs, templates.
5. **Finalize**: Copy BOM for future runs and log completion.

## Exit Codes
<!-- Symbolic outcomes of incantation -->
- `0` â€” Stubs generated successfully.
- `1` â€” BOM file not found or parse error.
- `2` â€” I/O error during directory or file creation.

## Examples
<!-- Sample invocations for celebratory rites -->
```bash
# Default expansion
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh

# Preview expansion without changes
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --dry-run

# Verbose expansion with detailed logs
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --verbose

# Show help
./bones/scripts/rc-expand.sh --help
```

Limerick 1:
From BOMâ€™s deep vaults, the stubs emerge,
rc-expand guides each hollow dirâ€™s surge.
It weaves frontmatter light,
In the still of the night,
And readies pages for loreâ€™s great purge.

Limerick 2:
In corridors of YAML decree,
rc-expand unlocks each MD entry.
It scaffolds with grace,
Then vanishes its trace,
Leaving blank tomes for scribes to decree.
