# rc-utils.sh

**Purpose:** Shared helper library for all Rotkeeper scripts, providing common flag parsing, logging, dry-run support, dependency checks, and error handling.

## Usage

This script is not invoked directly. Instead, each `rc-*.sh` script sources it at the top:

```bash
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/rc-utils.sh"
```

After sourcing, scripts call:

```bash
parse_flags "$@"
[[ "$HELP" == true ]] && show_help
```

then use the following helpers.

## Functions

- `parse_flags "$@"`
  Parses global flags:
  - `--dry-run`
  - `--verbose`
  - `--help`, `-h`

- `show_help()`
  Default help handler; overridden by individual scripts to display usage and exit.

- `log LEVEL MESSAGEâ€¦`
  Prints a timestamped log to stdout (and appended to script-specific log file).

- `run CMD [ARGâ€¦]`
  Runs the command with arguments unless `--dry-run` is active. Logs `DRY-RUN` if skipping. Preserves argument quoting and prevents shell splitting.

- `require_bins CMDâ€¦`
  Verifies each `CMD` is available in the system PATH; exits with error if any are missing.

- `trap_err LINE`
  Default error handler: logs an error with line number and exits.

- `cleanup()`
  No-op hook for cleanup; individual scripts can override to perform teardown.

- `require_env_vars VARâ€¦`
  Ensures required environment variables are set; exits with error if any are unset or empty.

- `init_log NAME`
  Initializes a log file in `LOG_DIR` with the given script name.

- `confirm PROMPT`
  Prompts user to confirm destructive action; exits unless response is affirmative.

## Example

```bash
# In rc-example.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/rc-utils.sh"
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

parse_flags "$@"
[[ "$HELP" == true ]] && show_help

main() {
  require_bins git yq
  log "INFO" "Running example"
  run "echo Hello, world!"
}

main "$@"
```

<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 1:
In the shadows of scripts all combined,
rc-utils keeps helpers aligned.
With flags parsed so neat,
Logs and runs compete,
And errors are neatly defined.
-->

<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 2:
When each script needs a guiding hand,
rc-utils will take a bold stand.
It checks and it logs,
Guards against clogs,
And lights up the whole Rotkeeper land.
-->
