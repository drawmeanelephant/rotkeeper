# ü™¶ rc-pack.sh

<!-- The sacred rite of tomb sealing and export -->

**Script Path:** `bones/scripts/rc-pack.sh`

## Purpose
<!-- Core objectives of rc-pack.sh -->
- Bundle the `output/` directory into a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive and log it in `bones/manifest.txt`.
- Export all Markdown under `home/content/` into a single JSON file for AI consumption and external indexing.

## CLI Interface
<!-- How to invoke the packing ceremony -->
```bash
rc-pack.sh [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--self] [--json-only] [--help]
```

Supported options:
- `--help`, `-h`
  Show usage information and exit.
- `--dry-run`, `-n`
  Preview actions without writing files.
- `--verbose`, `-v`
  Show detailed logs.
- `--self`
  Include the entire Rotkeeper project in the archive.
- `--json-only`
  Export Markdown to JSON only, skip tarball.

<!--
Limerick 1:
In cryptic halls, the tombs were bound,
rc-pack wrapped each sacred mound.
With JSON in hand,
And tarball at command,
The archive was sealed and crowned.

Limerick 2:
Across dusty files where Markdown lay,
rc-pack called forth their text array.
It bundled and scribed,
Then logged what survived,
Ensuring no relic would stray.
