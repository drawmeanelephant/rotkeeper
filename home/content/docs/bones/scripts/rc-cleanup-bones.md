<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 1:
In bones that once held scripts and lore,
rc-cleanup-bones would save and restore.
It backed up the tombs neat,
Then pruned old defeat,
Leaving archives to honor folklore.

<!-- ðŸŽ´ Limerick 2:
When backup folders grew out of hand,
This script lent a well-guided stand.
With tar and with find,
It culled whatâ€™s confined,
And kept your bones tidy and grand.
