# `rc-reseed.sh`

## üß† Purpose

To resurrect an archived site state‚Äîuseful for regression testing, audits, or timeline divergence. It is the opposite of `rc-pack.sh`.

---

## üåÄ Usage

<!-- üé¥ Limerick 1:
When old tombs lie silent and cold,
rc-reseed brings life untold.
It unpacks the past,
In memories vast,
And scripts from the archive unfold.
-->

<!-- üé¥ Limerick 2:
Should history‚Äôs bones need a spark,
this ritual revives each dark mark.
With tar‚Äôs gentle sweep,
It calls from the deep,
And lights up the shadows so stark.
