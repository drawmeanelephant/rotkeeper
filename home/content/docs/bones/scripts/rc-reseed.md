# `rc-reseed.sh`


---

## üß† Purpose

`rc-reseed.sh` is a resurrection utility that reconstructs a full Rotkeeper project structure.

It can:
- Unpack a `.tar.gz` tomb archive (legacy mode)
- Rehydrate scripts, docs, and configs from structured markdown binders created by `rc-book.sh`

This script is the inverse ritual of `rc-book.sh`, enabling round-trip rebuilds from curated documentation.

---

## üåÄ Usage

```bash
# Full reseed from all binders
./scripts/rc-reseed.sh --all

# Restore from a specific binder file
./scripts/rc-reseed.sh --input rotkeeper-docbook.md

# Dry run
./scripts/rc-reseed.sh --input rotkeeper-configbook.md --dry-run
```

<!-- üé¥ Limerick 1:
When old tombs lie silent and cold,
rc-reseed brings life untold.
It unpacks the past,
In memories vast,
And scripts from the archive unfold.
-->

<!-- üé¥ Limerick 2:
Should history‚Äôs bones need a spark,
this ritual revives each dark mark.
With tar‚Äôs gentle sweep,
It calls from the deep,
And lights up the shadows so stark.
-->

<!-- üé¥ Reseed Ritual:
From scriptbook to script, from docbook to prose,
From config to template the resurrection flows.
No database. No runtime.
Just bones. Just bash. Just right.
-->
