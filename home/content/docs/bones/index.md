> Rotkeeper is a ritual CLI for building, versioning, and preserving digital tombs.
> It tracks decay, embeds metadata, and renders the last good state of a flat-file system.
> It is not optimized. It is not scalable. It is designed to rot beautifully.

## 🧰 Capabilities

- 🏗️ Scaffold and initialize new tomb environments
- 📦 Pack reproducible `.tar.gz` tombs from versioned files
- 🧬 Apply `asset-meta` headers to every tracked script, template, and config
- 🕵️ Scan for missing assets, file drift, and forgotten metadata
- 🪞 Emit ritual logs and self-documenting playback scripts
- 📜 Dogfood itself across forgotten sites

## 🔩 Script Architecture

Rotkeeper is composed of a central CLI (`rk`) and sorted subroutines prefixed with `rc-`, e.g.:

- `rc-init.sh` — Initialize environment
- `rc-render.sh` — Render tomb content (Markdown → HTML via Pandoc)
- `rc-assets.sh` — Copy static assets into output folder
- `rc-scan.sh` — Detect unversioned or missing files
- `rc-pack.sh` — Pack all files into an archive

## 🧱 Project Philosophy

- Every file is treated as a tombstone.
- Every version is tracked in YAML.
- Every project is assumed to be on its last legs.

Rotkeeper is a system for maintaining end-of-life software with clarity, finality, and documentation as ritual.
