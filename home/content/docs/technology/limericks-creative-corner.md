# 🗿 Limericks & Creative Corner

Not all tombs must be solemn.  
Some decay deserves rhyme, rhythm, and ridicule.

This is the Rotkeeper creative enclave—where dead scripts find poetry, changelogs become punchlines, and every asset gets a eulogy if it asks nicely.

---

## 📜 Limericks About Logs

Rotkeeper emits logs in `yougood.brah`, but sometimes they deserve artistic interpretation:

> A script that was missing a dash  
> Caused output to render as trash  
> We patched it with grace  
> In the markdown base  
> And committed the rot in a flash

> The `render.sh` failed to obey  
> What the `manifest.txt` had to say  
> It skipped an old file  
> With a bureaucrat’s smile  
> And left it to rot in dismay

---

## 💀 Status Messages, Rewritten as Verse

Instead of:
```bash
[error] missing init-config.yaml
```

Try:
> No config was found in the tomb,  
> So the CLI whispered its gloom.  
> It refused to proceed,  
> Out of caution, not greed—  
> The ritual paused in the gloom.

## 🧱 Suggested Use Cases

- Embed haikus or limericks into your logs
- Use poetic error messages during rendering

## 🔮 Future Additions

- A limerick randomizer shell function (`rc-limerick.sh`)

LIMERICK

A log once delivered in rhyme,  
Marked timestamps that slipped out of time.  
With echo and flair,  
It looped through the air—  
And debugged itself into mime.

SORA PROMPT

"a haunted shell script that only speaks in limericks, floating error messages forming rhymed couplets, glitchy poetic syntax on a retro CRT"
