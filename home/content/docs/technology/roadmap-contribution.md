# 🗺️ Roadmap & Contribution

Rotkeeper is a living script graveyard. It survives because people keep feeding it new rituals, bugfixes, and ideas.

This page outlines where the project is headed and how you can get involved—whether you’re adding features, documenting rot, or blessing tombs with better metadata.

***

## 🧩 Current Focus Areas

- Finalizing the `rotkeeper` CLI wrapper
- Stabilizing core `rc-*` subroutines
- Creating more complete documentation examples and style guides
- Expanding support for multi-project setups and rot snapshots
- Formalizing the version bump + changelog ritual (`rc-bless.sh`)
- Testing and validation tooling (`rc-scan.sh`, `rc-verify.sh`)
- Building thematic assets and icon sets (HiQ, OpenMoji)

***

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Web-based rot visualizer (CLI output to HTML)
- “Blessed version” file generator with cryptographic fingerprinting
- `.rotstyle` and `.tombignore` for custom project behavior
- A `rotkeeper record` feature that emits a reproducible build script
- Script inheritance & theming (persona-driven templates)
- Graveyard server: auto-host rendered tombs from `.tar.gz`

***

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Rotkeeper is rot-positive. That means no PR is too weird, too dead, or too late.

If you want to contribute:
- Fork the project and create a branch
- Include `# asset-meta` headers on all scripts or templates you edit
- Run your changes through `rotkeeper init` + `render` to ensure they work
- Open a PR with a limerick in the description (optional but respected)

LIMERICK

A roadmap was buried with grace,
Each bullet entombed in its place.
The futures were dim,
Each line like a hymn—
To rot that transcended the trace.

SORA PROMPT

"a roadmap etched into cracked stone, project ideas half-lit like neon glyphs, contributions whispered by spectral programmers in the void"
