# üîç Scan & Verify Tools

These are the paranoid instruments of the archive cult. `rc-scan.sh` and `rc-verify.sh` form the dual-eyes of the Rotkeeper‚Äîone staring into the live filesystem, the other probing the sealed tombs. They exist to catch decay before it becomes doctrine.

They complement one another: `rc-scan.sh` surfaces issues **in the current filesystem**, while `rc-verify.sh` inspects **archived tombs** and ensures SHA integrity against manifests.

***

## üìÇ What Gets Scanned?

Tools like `rc-scan.sh` and `rc-verify.sh` inspect:

- bones/manifest.txt: expected tomb contents
- bones/asset-manifest.yaml: tracked file versions
- home/content/**/*.md: user-written tombdocs
- output/**/*.html: rendered pages checked for missing assets
- Script and template `asset-meta` blocks
- Output folders (e.g. `/output/`, `/logs/`) for untracked files

For full usage details, see [`rc-scan.sh`](../bones/scripts/rc-scan.md) and [`rc-verify.sh`](../bones/scripts/rc-verify.md).

***

## üß™ `rc-scan.sh`

This script walks the current environment and compares it to the tomb's manifest. It detects:

- Missing files listed in `bones/manifest.txt`
- Orphaned files that exist but are not tracked
- Assets referenced in rendered HTML that no longer exist
- Markdown or script files missing `asset-meta:` frontmatter

Flags supported:
- `--manifest-only`: skip disk scan, only report manifest status
- `--json-only`, `--md-only`: limit output format
- `--dry-run`: preview actions
- `--verbose`: show extra debug info

Output includes a Markdown report in `home/content/rotkeeper/scan-report-*.md` and a JSON version in `bones/reports/scan-report-*.json`.

***

## üìè `rc-verify.sh`

This script compares file hashes against `asset-manifest.yaml`. It confirms that each listed file:

- Exists on disk
- Matches its recorded SHA256 checksum
- Was not silently modified or regenerated

This is most useful after a pack/unpack cycle or before release. Failure will surface any corrupted or tampered content.

Flags:
- `--quiet`: suppress normal output, exit codes only
- `--manifest`: verify manifest entries only, skip full tomb unpack

## üßæ Sample Output: Markdown Scan Report

```markdown
## Missing Files
- bones/templates/ritual-missing.html

## Orphan Files
- home/assets/forgotten-favicon.ico

## File Digests
- `bones/scripts/rc-pack.sh`: a1b2c3d4e5f6‚Ä¶
```

***

## üß† Tips for Verification Workflows

- Run `rc-scan.sh` before every `rc-pack.sh` to catch uncommitted decay
- Automate `rc-verify.sh` in your CI to validate `.tar.gz` outputs
- Consider writing diffs between manifest versions to surface unexpected drift

Example integration into a CI pipeline:

```bash
bash rc-render.sh
bash rc-pack.sh
bash rc-scan.sh --json-only
bash rc-verify.sh --quiet
# Full scan/verify loop before archival
```

Exit codes:
- `0`: no issues
- `1`: warnings or mismatches (non-fatal)
- `2`: missing dependencies, unreadable manifests, or structural failures

Trust no tomb that hasn‚Äôt been scanned.

LIMERICK

A scanner inspected the tomb,
Declared certain headers in gloom.
It flagged them with care,
Some vanished, some bare‚Äî
And verified files in the room.

SORA PROMPT
