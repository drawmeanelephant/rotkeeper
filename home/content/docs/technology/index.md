# 🧪 Rotkeeper Technology Index

This section documents the internal tech stack, shell-based tools, and output rituals that power Rotkeeper. Use these pages to understand how the CLI operates behind the scenes, and how each script relates to your rendered tombs, logs, assets, and audits.

## 📚 Pages

1. [⚡ Quickstart Guide](quickstart-guide.md)
   Get running with minimal ceremony. Setup, first render, pack, and bless.

2. [🗒️ CLI Commands](cli-commands.md)
   Describes each `rc-*.sh` script: purpose, flags, inputs, outputs.

3. [⚙️ Configuration Reference](config-reference.md)
   All YAML knobs, environment flags, and how render-flags.yaml gets interpreted.

4. [🪵 Logging & Reports](logging-reports.md)
   Where logs go, what `bones/logs/` holds, and how reports are used in audits.

5. [🔐 Scan & Verify Tools](scan-verify-tools.md)
   How `rc-scan.sh` and `rc-verify.sh` detect missing, mismatched, or orphaned files.

6. [🤖 CI/CD Integration](ci-cd-integration.md)
   Automate tomb generation with cron jobs, GitHub Actions, or bash-driven deploy loops.
