## üß† Rotkeeper v0.2.0 Hardening Checklist

This section consolidates the status, review, and next-phase plan for your CLI system as of late v0.1.9.9.

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working Well

1. **Modular Scripts**
   Every major ritual step has its own `rc-*.sh` handler‚Äîexpand, render, pack, scan, assets, record, status, reseed, cleanup, docs-fix, audit, API pulls, init‚Äîso it‚Äôs easy to target individual phases.

2. **Consistent Logging Pattern**
   Almost every script defines a `log()` helper and traps cleanup on exit, writing to `bones/logs/‚Ä¶`. That gives you a uniform audit trail.

3. **Flag-Driven Modes**
   Many scripts already support `--dry-run`, `--self`, `--manifest-only`, `--verbose`, etc., which will let you test and fine-tune without accidentally mutating real state.

4. **Self-Containment & Self-Replication**
   Some scripts even copy themselves or pack the whole suite for bone-deep portability (e.g. `rc-reseed.sh` and your earlier dump mechanism).

5. **Poetic Ritual Flavor**
   Limericks, glyphs, and atmospheric comments make this fun to read and maintain‚Äîgreat for onboarding new cultists.

***

### üîß Areas to Harden

1. **Unify Flag Parsing & Helpers**
   Extract a shared lib (`bones/scripts/rotkeeper-lib.sh`) for `parse_flags`, `log`, `require_cmds` etc. Reduce boilerplate and unify behavior.

2. **Standardize Exit Codes**
   Use:
   - `0` = all good
   - `1` = minor issues (missing files, warnings)
   - `2` = critical failure or missing dependency

3. **Centralize Config Paths**
   Move shared path definitions to a config file or sourced script (`rotkeeper-paths.sh`).

4. **Simplify Script Seeding**
   Replace BOM-script stub loop with a prebuilt `scripts.tar.gz` to unpack on expand/init.

5. **Finish Scan & Audit Tools**
   Implement `rc-scan.sh` and `rc-audit.sh` fully per BOM specs, enabling full digest/frontmatter validation.

6. **Add Tests**
   Write a `tests/` harness that runs init‚Üírender‚Üíscan‚Üípack, catching regressions.

7. **Update Docs**
   Polish `configuration-reference.md`, `README.md`, and rendered output to reflect current CLI workflows and flags.

8. Standardize parse_flags() usage (support associative arrays) across all rc-*.sh scripts.
9. Ensure every script sources rc-env.sh and rc-utils.sh, calls init_log, uses require_bins, and wraps external calls in run().
10. Add --dry-run support to rc-book.sh (and any scripts lacking it).
12. Create rc-env.sh to centralize root path variables (bones/, output/, home/, etc.).
***

### üéØ Next Concrete Steps

1. Extract and source a common helper for flags, logging, and dependency checks.
2. Implement `rc-scan.sh` metadata collection & report generation.
3. Refactor `rc-expand.sh` to unpack a bundled script archive.
4. Write a smoke-test harness that validates full init‚Üípack flow.
5. Update `docs/` to reflect v0.2.0 logic and structure.
6. Enable Pandoc-driven in-page Table of Contents via `--toc` flag and update `render-flags.yaml`.
7. Inject `asset-meta` JSON into rendered HTML pages by extending the Pandoc template.

***

## üîß Manifest Hygiene

- [ ] Deduplicate `manifest.txt` entries during all phases (`init`, `inject`, `render`)
- [ ] Add `sort -u` pass after each `log_manifest` call
- [ ] Ensure `manifest.txt` is not polluted by multiple identical entries

***

## üì¶ Archive & Packing Cleanliness

- [x] Validate `.tar.gz` tomb contents (‚úÖ no duplicates)
- [ ] Improve log output: clarify repeated lines vs packed entries
- [ ] Add post-pack message summarizing tomb contents count

- [ ] Annotate TODO list with hidden Sora prompt placeholders for future tone-setting.

- [ ] Add a confirm() helper in rc-utils.sh for destructive operations (e.g., rc-cleanup-bones.sh).
- [ ] Update log() helper to write to both stdout and $LOG_DIR/<script>.log.

***

## üîç Script Compliance Audit

- [ ] Ensure all `rc-*.sh` scripts define `main()` and use `trap` safely
- [ ] Apply `set -euo pipefail` to every script

***


***

## üßÉ Script Stub Logic

- [ ] Only create script stubs if file does not exist or still contains `# TODO`
- [ ] Prevent overwriting functional scripts during `rotkeeper init`
- [ ] Log clearly whether a stub was created vs. a real script preserved

LIMERICK

A checklist that kept getting longer,
Each ritual entry grew stronger.
Though nothing was done,
The logs showed it won‚Äî
And the tombshell grew buggier, not wronger.

SORA PROMPT

"a decaying checklist on old paper, taped to a terminal, slowly being updated by a ghostly archivist with a flickering cursor"
